# Housing-Price-Prediction



This repository contains a Python script for building a house price prediction pipeline. The pipeline performs data imputation, feature scaling, finding correlations and model training using scikit-learn.

Usage:

Install dependencies: Ensure you have scikit-learn and other necessary libraries installed.
Load data: Replace the placeholder code for loading your housing price data.
Build and train the pipeline: Create an instance of Pipeline with the specified steps, and call fit_transform on your data.
Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict on new, preprocessed data.
Example:


Testing (modeltest.ipynb):

Split your data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics.
